# Predictive Maintenance with Machine Learning ðŸ”§

This project applies ML techniques to **predict machine failures** before they happen.  
Inspired by real-world Industrial IoT datasets.  

## Features
- Feature engineering on sensor data
- Classification models (Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Model evaluation with Precision-Recall and AUC
- Deployment-ready notebook for fast experiments

## Future Work
- Deep Learning approach (LSTM for time-series)
- REST API deployment with FastAPI
